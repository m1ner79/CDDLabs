### Lab2 

The idea behind the Lab2 is signalling with semaphores.

### List of files and what they contain:

- **Semaphore.h** - The header file for the Semaphore class. This file is provided
for your use. Make sure you understand how it works.
- **Semaphore.cpp** - The implementation file for the Semaphore class. This file is provided for your use. Make sure you understand how it works.
- **main.cpp** - The file containing the main function. This main function must create at least two threads where one thread signals the other using a common Semaphore. In this lab this is where all your code will go.
- **Makefile** - This is the project file. It contains rules that tell the system how to compile the code and produce a working executable called signal.
- **doxyfile** -  This file contains the settings for the Doxygen tool. It is generated by the doxygen program when run for the first time.
- **doxydoc** - This folder contains files generated with doxygen program.
